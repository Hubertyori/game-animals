# Animals

######Part 3#################################

I changed the game baseded on both my project and the project of lab class.

![my_Game Animals](https://github.com/Hubertyori/game-animals/blob/huixiaoyang/SVID_20180325_205137_20180325205639.gif)

First I added two number in the play activity one for the socre which is added when you choose the right animal, the other is the chances that you left. When you pushed one button, your chances get losted. And when you use out the chances ,the game will present the congratulations interface. And place your score on it, if you want to try again, you can push the "play again" button.

when you choose the wrong you lose your chance and the animal will went dark, until you choose the right animal.
